## Files explained

### `.env`

Environment variables used by Flask. 

- Do not upload this to GitHub if cloning / forking this repository as it contains sensitive variables like the secret key. Include in the .gitignore file!
- For local development, the environment variables in this file can be automatically loaded by installing the `python-dotenv` package.
- If using Docker, the environment variables can be passed to Docker when running the container with the `docker run [...] --env-file=.env` parameter

The important variables contained in the file are:

- `FLASK_APP=flaskexampleapp`: instructs Flask which application to run when calling `flask run`
- `FLASK_ENV=development`: sets Flask to development mode with full debugging
- `SECRET_KEY=secret_key`: the secret key used by the WTForms module against CSRF attacks. Don't publish this key!

# Build and run

Build and run the Docker container with the following commands:

```shell
$ docker build --tag flask-docker-example .
$ docker run --name flask --detach --publish 8000:5000 --env-file=.env --rm flask-docker-example
```



# Error messages

If you receive the following error message when running the Docker container:

`standard_init_linux.go:219: exec user process caused: no such file or directory`

Change the CRLF in VSCode to LF and save the `boot.sh` file with a Unix line ending.
